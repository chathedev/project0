# Breeze Landing Page

Elegant single-page marketing site built with React and Vite. The design leans into a light, airy aesthetic with animated floating accents, soft gradients, and smooth scroll-triggered reveals. Sections include hero, features, about, showcase, testimonials, pricing, and a contact form.

## Tech Stack

- React 19 with functional components
- Vite for bundling and lightning-fast dev experience
- Modern CSS (no external UI framework) with custom animations and responsive layout

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the URL printed in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

### Additional Scripts

- `npm run build` – production build
- `npm run preview` – preview built assets locally
- `npm run lint` – run ESLint across the project

## Structure Highlights

- `src/App.jsx` – section markup and simple intersection-observer animation hook
- `src/App.css` – page layout, gradients, glassmorphism cards, and responsive rules
- `src/index.css` – typography, resets, and global tokens

Feel free to tailor copy, colors, or sections to suit your brand.
